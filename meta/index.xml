      <title>Needs assessment interview template</title>
      <link>https://unicef.github.io/inventory/meta/needs-assessment-template/</link>

      <guid>https://unicef.github.io/inventory/meta/needs-assessment-template/</guid>
      <description>This document is an interview template for needs assessments with UNICEF Innovation Fund cohorts in Open Source induction calls. The needs assessment is a tool to collect background and context for each team’s experience and familiarity with open source. It also builds understanding for participation in existing open source communities. This template provides structure and guidance on what to ask to any team at the beginning of an Open Source Mentorship program.</description>

      <description>Open Source data and analytics are used across multiple tools and documents for talking about Innovation Fund portfolio companies. When updating data sources in official UNICEF portals, follow this process for the quickest way of updating metrics.
  Open data input source (e.g. Sharepoint doc, Google Doc shared with company, etc.)
  Open Cauldron.io dashboard for company/project
  Look at annual ranges first before doing quarterly ranges. Some metrics need to be collected manually for annual ranges:</description>
