							value: "Introduction to Open Source Hardware",
							label: "<p>So… you want to know about Open Source Hardware? This page is an introduction to what Open Source Hardware means, how it works, and why it matters. Other pages in this Open Source Heuristic category will expand your understanding of Open Source Hardware; however, if you need a place to begin, this is a good start!\n See the following sections below:\n  What is Open Source Hardware?\n Takeaway\n     Where does Open Source Hardware exist today?\n  Why Open Source Hardware is a win for your project\n Reason no. 1: Reproducibility\n  Reason no. 2: Community participation\n  Reason no. 3: Trademark protections\n     Open Source Hardware Association\n  Resources and other references\n   What is Open Source Hardware? Open Source Hardware, sometimes abbreviated as O.S.H.W., is sometimes used as a general term to describe hardware projects developed in an open way. However, the Open Source Hardware Association maintains a common definition of Open Source Hardware, as agreed upon by several stakeholders and contributors to Open Hardware projects.\n  Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.\n  — Open Source Hardware Association   Just like Open Source software, the key definition of Open Hardware includes the Four Freedoms to use, study, share, and improve. The Open Source Hardware Definition provides a common language, standard, and legal framework for Open Source Hardware projects. Using Open Source Hardware developed according to this definition reduces legal and compliance risk for these kinds of projects.\n The Open Source Hardware Association also provides a clear idea of what they mean by \u0026#34;hardware\u0026#34; in the definition:\n  Open Source Hardware (OSHW) is a term for tangible artifacts — machines, devices, or other physical things — whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, distribute, and use those things. This definition is intended to help provide guidelines for the development and evaluation of licenses for Open Source Hardware. Hardware is different from software in that physical resources must always be committed for the creation of physical goods. Accordingly, persons or companies producing items (“products”) under an OSHW license have an obligation to make it clear that such products are not manufactured, sold, warrantied, or otherwise sanctioned by the original designer and also not to make use of any trademarks owned by the original designer.\n  — Open Source Hardware Association   Takeaway So, the main idea or point to understand about Open Source Hardware? Whenever we talk about Open Source Hardware projects, we need to make sure we are using common language. Open Source Hardware does not prohibit or forbid commercialization, but it does offer protections for unique trademarks and responsibilities from liability. When an Open Source Hardware project is released, we always promise end-users four rights. You can remember them as the Four R’s:\n  Read: Anyone can read the specs and see how the hardware is designed and built. There are instructions provided about how to do so.\n  Reproduce: Anyone can make their own hardware using the specs. There are no absolute restrictions on how the hardware must be used.\n  Revise: Anyone can make changes to the specs in any way they wish.\n  Redistribute: Anyone can share their changes to the specs with others.\n      Where does Open Source Hardware exist today? This site provides several examples of popular Open Source Hardware projects. Look at the Project Hall of Fame for many different examples. Review the Case studies for detailed explanations about different Open Source Hardware projects and businesses.\n   Why Open Source Hardware is a win for your project The Open Source Hardware option is a competitive strategy for a new product or creation, if planned correctly. Choosing to work Open Source allows to be more successful in collaboration and creating new partnerships. Its focus on reproduction and standardization across borders makes it a competitive option for deploying new hardware with potential to scale.\n However, there are a few distinct, key reasons why an Open Source Hardware route is a win for your next product. This list is not exhaustive and focuses more narrowly on the start-up perspective:\n Reason no. 1: Reproducibility Open Source Hardware should be reproducible. Generally, this means using commonly-available components and standardized conventions. It also requires reliable documentation on reproduction of the hardware itself. By generalizing where possible and providing useful documentation, it empowers others to reproduce the same device in a different geographical context or market.\n Successful Open Source Hardware projects take reproducibility to heart. It is a defining characteristic of those projects, although they may sometimes be a smaller component in a larger proprietary hardware project. By leveraging reproducibility to the fullest, it will best prepare you for the next major benefit of Open Source Hardware projects.\n  Reason no. 2: Community participation Open Source Hardware projects can benefit by leveraging feedback loops by communities of makers and modders from around the world. The participation of diverse contributors allows you to create strategic new partnerships and create innovative work more quickly. However, you only stand to benefit from this community participation if you have both a clearly reproducible project, and an active approach to community management and growing a healthy community around the project.\n  Reason no. 3: Trademark protections Finally, Open Source Hardware projects also benefit from trademark protection. Even though you release your hardware schematics and documentation as Open Source, this does not allow the general public to use marks that may confuse your organization with changes made to the software by others in the ecosystem. Trademarks often seem trivial or unimportant in the beginning of an Open Source project. However, if the project will scale, the trademarks of the primary owner of a project need to be clearly defined to clearly distinguish the original project from any community forks.\n Are you starting a new project? If you are starting fresh, you have room for creativity. Think about how to market or promote your project through its name or a logo. For projects intended for wider public participation, spend the time early to build the brand of the project and clearly identify any marks. This will become useful in the future to support a product brand and a community brand.\n    Open Source Hardware Association Open Source Hardware is defined by the Open Source Hardware Association (O.S.H.W.A.). O.S.H.W.A. provides a certification process for producers to indicate their products meet a uniform and well-defined standard. Certification is a valuable milestone for any product considering to release as Open Source Hardware. It builds trust and transparency into how you market and promote your product as genuine Open Source Hardware.\n For more questions about O.S.H.W.A. certification, see their Frequently Asked Questions page.\n   Resources and other references   What is Open Hardware?

Details and resources are below.\n  Milestone 1: Understanding the Data Flow\n Data Ecosystem Map\n  Information Sharing Protocol\n     Milestone 2: Understanding the Algorithm\n Dataset Structure\n  Common Traps Mitigations\n     Milestone 3: Sharing the Model\n Model Card Created\n      Understanding Data Flow   Primary Goal: Create documentation that ensures you know what data you’re using and how you plan on sharing it.\n   This first milestone is about initially understanding the underlying data powering your model. This is generally important for understanding the plumbing and getting an idea about privacy and implications that may arise from sharing data.\n Outcomes   Data Ecosystem Map: This is to document where their data is coming from, what’s using it, stakeholders, etc. The benefit here is not just helping organize how data collection will work in production but also projecting partnerships which may need to be formed in the future.\n  Information Sharing Protocol: This document is all about conducting an initial assessment of the sensitivity of information you are collecting, who you want to share it with, and how. It is fairly well-thought but is worth a review and potentially some edits. If you are in the EU, it might just be better to do a Data Protection Impact Assessment.\n      Understanding the Algorithm   Primary Goal: Create documentation to ensure your whole team understand exactly how your model will be working.\n   A large part of this will be determining the method of managing your datasets as they evolve over the development of the program.\n Outcomes   Determine Dataset Structure: As you create new data sets, update them, and remove old datasets, you should follow an easy to follow protocol for keeping track of your various data sets as they are updated and deprecated.\n  Common Traps When Building Models: Review the following traps and document potential risks of your application falling into any of these traps.\n      Documenting the Algorithm   Primary Goal: Produce documentation that should be shared with the model.\n   Outcomes   Document Machine Learning Model Card: Before you release or begin production use of your machine learning model, you can use the linked template to comprehensively document the effects, background, and purpose of your model. This will serve as a core document showing how the model makes the decision it does.\n      </p>",

							value: "Business sustainability for Open Source",
							label: "<p> This page collects information, best practices, and other resources for business sustainability of Open Source projects.\n Business models Specific business models or approaches used by other Open Source projects and communities. This section is small but will continue to grow as more knowledge is collected and centralized together.\n Training \u0026amp; support One popular approach to business sustainability is offering training and support for your Open Source product. Your project is Open Source. You may also have documentation that explains how to use it. However, some clients need extra support to integrate new technology into a complex environment. Training and support for using the Open Source software is used by a range of Open Source projects.\n This section explores specific examples to review for inspiration and ideas on what this looks like.\n Red Hat Red Hat is a well-known U.S. software company known for their Open Source operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In addition to RHEL, Red Hat has several other products for enterprise software development with Open Source technology and tools. In many cases, Red Hat is either the largest or one of the largest contributors to several Open Source technologies. However, Red Hat also recognizes the need to validate end-user knowledge of their technologies and to create new relationships with users of their technology. In addition to creating a new revenue stream for the business, it also puts them closer to the needs and feedback of their clients or future clients.\n For validation of end-user knowledge, Red Hat has an extensive portfolio of certifications. A selection is shown below:\n   Red Hat certification portal (all certifications)\n  Red Hat Certified System Administrator\n  Red Hat Certified Architect\n  Red Hat Certified Specialist in Containers and Kubernetes\n       Dronfies Labs \u0026amp; Portable UTM (Uruguay) Dronfies Lab, a UNICEF Innovation investee, creates the Open Source tool Portable UTM. Portable UTM is an Open Source Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management system, or U.T.M., for low-connectivity environments in order to support drone delivery and emergency response. It is developed with respect to the NASA UAS Service Supplier Specification. Dronfies provides a profile of their collaboration with UNICEF Innovation during their investment period with the Fund.\n Dronfies uses training as a way to both generate revenue and also to empower their users to use their tools most effectively. Dronfies training is made more competitive by their compliance with the NASA UAS Service Supplier Specification. Receiving training by Dronfies with Portable UTM enables trainees to work with other tools that also comply with the common standard. Additionally, training services builds end-user knowledge of the application. New users get up to speed faster by using the new tool according to best practices.\n Learn more on the Portable UTM website.\n  Stock Knowledge (The Philippines) Stock Knowledge is a Summer 2020 Generation Unlimited inductee with the UNICEF Innovation Fund. Stock Knowledge uses training as a method to support their Open Source Learning Management System (L.M.S.). Check back for more info soon.\n     </p>",

							value: "Case studies",
							label: "<p> Below are more detailed case studios of different Open Hardware organizations, projects, and products. Unlike the Projects page, these examples are more detailed and provide more context.\n Opentrons Scientific-focused hardware.\n  Several highly successful and well-regarded biology\/chemistry lab automation robots. By going 100% open source, they substantially reduced costs. Their products’ prices sometimes undercuts competition by 10x. They also acquired venture capital (V.C.) funding.\n Having worked in biology labs myself, I can attest to how revolutionary their open source business model is. It doesn’t just save cost. Since everything is open source, scientists who use their products avoid vendor lock-in and some even create their own modifications. This is shared with other scientists and builds a stronger ecosystem around Opentrons.\n  — Pen-Yuan Hsing     Arduino  This is probably the most famous example. The official Arduino boards are 100% open source. By being fully open source, this allow Arduino boards a significant amount of free publicity. User contributions also feed into their future products, thereby lowering R\u0026amp;D costs. The business strategy for the Arduino is that anyone can directly copy, manufacture, and sell clones, but they cannot brand them as \u0026#34;Arduino\u0026#34;. Only boards made by the company can be officially called Arduino. \u0026#34;Arduino\u0026#34; itself is trademarked, which does not affect its open source nature.\n  — Pen-Yuan Hsing     REMODEL toolkit  The REMODEL toolkit that helps you uncover how to create economically sustainable open source-based business models. This is done through seven phases of hands-on design exercises and practical experimentation. The toolkit is licensed under CC BY-SA and has been successfully used by multiple real-life businesses.\n  — Pen-Yuan Hsing     Honorable mentions The following case studies are honorable mentions. They are honorable mentions because they either partially implement Open Hardware design or methodologies, but fall short in other ways.\n Ultimate Hacking Keyboard Consumer-focused hardware. Source code is available online, but it is released under custom proprietary licenses. The custom licenses violate the Four Freedoms of Free Software: specifically, the freedom to use. However, it is still an interesting project, so it is included here as a reference.\n Here is what one of our contributors had to say about it:\n  They bootstrapped their business by starting small. They also had a successful round of crowdfunding. To know my knowledge, this company is now self-sufficient (or close to), and their keyboards get amazing reviews. Because hardware and firmware are [public], users create custom modifications and extensions that end essentially provide free advertising.\n      </p>",

							value: "Codes of Conduct",
							label: "<p>    This Mission is a short exercise on understanding how Codes of Conduct fit into your Open Source community. In designing a Code of Conduct for a project community, we will explore these Requirements for this Mission:\n  Quality of writing\n  Clarity of expectations\n  Defined structure for handling enforcement\n  Two to four people responsible for handling sensitive reports\n  Use an existing Code of Conduct instead of writing one yourself\n  References\n   Quality of writing A Code of Conduct is an international document. Unless you have equivalent translations by native speakers of other languages, the reader may not read or speak English like a native speaker. So, use simple, easy to understand language and keep your vocabulary clear and simple.\n Consider this checklist when evaluating on evaluating quality of writing for a Code of Conduct:\n  Few grammatical, technical, and semantic errors\n  Seek feedback from diverse people who may not be native English speakers\n  Avoids complex words or contextual phrases\n     Clarity of expectations A Code of Conduct states how your community is expected to behave. But it also states expectations of how things are handled when that behavior is not followed. A clear set of rules paired with examples makes it easier to label certain categories of wanted or unwanted community behavior.\n Consider this checklist when evaluating on how clear expectations are set for a Code of Conduct:\n  Essential verbosity level (a behavioral goal could be no more than 2-3 paragraphs per section)\n  Focus on broad identifications of negative behavior: Continually labeling toxic behavior is a never-ending rabbit hole. The number of combinations and permutations of bad\/toxic behavior is significantly high. It is more rewarding of planning effort to define positive and welcoming behavior. This will make it easier to define examples of what acceptable or exemplary behavior is like in your community.\n  Err on over-describing what you do want instead of what you don’t want: Aim on setting clear expectations for what behavior is welcomed and encouraged in a project community.\n     Defined structure for handling enforcement Inevitably, someone will come along to your project who tests any thin lines in what your Code of Conduct is clear (or not) on. Publicly documenting how moderation and enforcement is reviewed builds trust and sets clear expectations. This does not mean you label out in great detail to the public on how a complaint travels through your organization. But it should be clear on who reviews complaints, when they see them, and why they see them. Even if someone does not know the result or outcome of every step, they should know what those steps are.\n Consider this checklist when evaluating on a defined enforcement structure:\n  Publicly explain how behavior complaints are reviewed and by whom: Identify how a complaint travels through your organization. Create a network or transparent map of how a complaint is reviewed, by whom in the organization, and who defines consequences for unacceptable behavior.\n  Explain when someone is brought in or added to a complaint review: The consent of the reporter must always be sought for changes to view access of a private complaint. The reporter should know when they will be contacted and for what.\n  Art. 17 G.D.P.R. - Right to erase (\u0026#34;right to be forgotten\u0026#34;): At any point, the reporter may request an end to an investigation where they are a reported victim. Their identity should be erased from official records. The complaint of behavior does not need to be erased nor of whom it is a complaint of. But the reporter’s contact information must be anonymized and disconnected from other data objects or representations. (Selling or sharing private data on behavior of specific individuals may be a different legal question altogether.)\n     Two to four people responsible for handling sensitive reports Responsibility for handling sensitive reports must be explicit. Between two to four people should be included in handling first-contact reports. Having more than one person avoids bias if a report is about the person who handles reports. Sage Sharp has a more thorough explanation of why this is important.\n Consider this checklist when evaluating on how sensitive reports are handled:\n  Recusion in personal cases: If a complaint is about a person who oversees sensitive reports, they are immediately recused of any inclusion in the decision-making process. They are treated the same as a member of the community who was the subject of a report. Their role as a first-responder must not bias the first response for a complaint.\n  Define elevation criteria: Determine what disciplinary action is available to the group of first-responders and (approximately) when additional elevation is required. This way, complaints don’t get stuck in indecision.\n     Use an existing Code of Conduct instead of writing one yourself The previous sections focused on less-talked about, but equally important parts of implementing a Code of Conduct. But what about actually writing the \u0026#34;legal\u0026#34; text? A Code of Conduct is in effect a legal document. In the world of licenses, we are often told not to write our own licenses and instead use one already available and widely understood in our legal systems.\n The same mindset is useful when evaluating a Code of Conduct. Avoid writing your own and use one that already exists and is more widely-used if possible. This way, you can focus on the more challenging questions of defining enforcement instead of also becoming junior policy authors.\n   References   Open Source Guide - Code of Conduct\n  Popular examples:\n  Contributor Covenant (recommended - widely used, provides template to fill out\n  Django Code of Conduct\n  Citizen Code of Conduct\n        </p>",

							label: "<p>This guide is an introduction to Continuous Integration (C.I.) for Open Source projects. In this guide, you will learn about the following topics:\n  What is CI and why does it matter?\n Tests vs. CI\n  Benefits\n     CI platforms\n  Tips and tricks\n  Examples\n  Other resources\n   What is CI and why does it matter? Continuous Integration can be a few different things. However, for the open source context, think of CI as the tool or platform which runs a code test suite. A CI platform will run an open source project’s code test suite and report the test results back in real-time. You can even get this feedback before adding new code into a project.\n Tests vs. CI It is important to distinguish code test suites from CI platforms.\n A code test suite usually means the actual tests themselves. The tests might use a framework like Pytest, Google Test, go test, Mocha, RSpec, or one of countless others. When the test suite is run, it provides some kind of guarantee that the code shipped works as designed and as it should.\n CI platforms can be simple or complex. At their simplest, they are \u0026#34;wrappers\u0026#34; for the code test suite. A CI job sets up the infrastructure and environment needed for the software, and then runs the code test suite.\n So, in a way, a CI platform is a tool to automate running your code test suite and allows you to integrate test results into the development process.\n  Benefits Using a CI platform provides benefits both for agile software development and open source.\n For agile software development, a CI platform enables developers to get real-time feedback about whether new changes are compatible with existing code in the project. Before code gets added, a developer gets a green flag or a red flag for the results of the test suite. Developers will be able to avoid common human errors and mistakes in their code before they are added.\n The open source view is both practical and also psychological:\n  Practical: New contributors or team members can use a test suite to avoid making common mistakes while learning a new codebase.\n  Psychological: Open source contributors are more confident to make changes because there is a safety net, in case there are unexpected side effects from their changes.\n   The practical benefits apply equally to your core team members and outside contributors. In a Pull Request, a CI platform will post the test results into the Pull Request. A developer or core team member will know immediately whether the test suite is still working, or if their changes may have introduced new bugs.\n The psychological benefits are more focused towards anyone (new team members or outside contributors) who are still new to the project. It is difficult for someone to step up and decide to contribute to an open source project! A test suite and CI platform makes it easier by letting a new contributor be bold in making new changes, provided the test suite still passes at the end. The contributor can run the test suite locally before they propose their changes to the project.\n    CI platforms There are many different CI platforms available. Which one is best for you depends on your specific needs, what features are available, and what kinds of third-party integrations you need. This guide will not cover them all, but here are some of the most popular ones:\n   Circle CI\n  GitHub Actions\n  GitLab CI\n  Jenkins (powerful, but notoriously difficult to set up)\n  Travis CI\n   Note many of these platforms have no-cost plans for software released under open source licenses. However, usually you will have to pay if using CI on a private or hidden repository. Additionally, all of these platforms have extensive documentation. Read up on their docs to learn more!\n   Tips and tricks This is a short list of tips, tricks, and common traps to avoid when integrating CI into your project:\n  All changes should be Pull Requests: To get the most benefit out of a CI tool, all changes to your codebase should be made via a Pull Request. No committing directly to master or production!\n  Use caching for faster builds: All CI platforms usually have some kind of caching feature, if configured. Especially for larger projects, this can lead to huge speed-ups with how long your test suite takes to run.\n  Block new changes from merging if tests fail: If your test suite reports back with errors, do not add the proposed code into the main codebase. Fix the code for the tests first, and then add the changes. If you must make a one-time exception, do not delay in fixing your tests as soon as possible. Otherwise, developers might ignore them altogether (even for valid tests).\n  Keep writing tests: As long as you are writing new code, you should also be writing new tests. Remember, the benefits of CI will not be realized if you are not consistently testing your code.\n     Examples Need some examples of projects using a Continuous Integration pipeline?

							label: "<p>This is a summary of a talk, \u0026#34;Uncharted waters: Documenting emerging technology\u0026#34;. It was given at DevConf 2020 in Brno, Czech Republic by Andrew Burden.\n Video      Abstract  We can’t help but feel the lure towards the hot new thing, especially when it comes to technology. Part of that lure is the breaking of ground, venturing into the unknown, and working on solutions to new problems. But a lot of the same things that make emerging technology fun and exciting to work on are exactly why it can be difficult to document. These challenges are quite different to those associated with mature products.\n This talk is for anyone working on new products and emerging technology, or just interested in learning about fast-moving documentation. It is for the developer as much as it is for the writer, since it usually falls to them to write the early docs before a writer is added to the team.\n  — Andrew Burden     Summary Lately I work with “emerging technology,” which means different things to different people. Regardless of what emerging tech means to you, Andrew focused on how to write documentation in a fast-paced environment with “pre-release” technology, where things change fast and suddenly. Normally this is an excuse to not write docs, but Andrew showed, yes! It is possible to write good docs, even when context changes fast and often.\n Key considerations of fast-paced technical writers An even balance of these considerations helps get into a user’s mindset:\n  Scope \/ scale of release\n  Release schedule\n  Developer meetings \/ face-time\n  Exposure with $TECHNOLOGY\n  Deployment experience with $TECHNOLOGY\n    Surviving the information wall The “information wall” is the endless wall of information and things to know about a project. If information is endless, how do technical writers survive?\n   Take notes: Be like a scientist\n  Take notes about your notes\n  Be organized with your notes\n   Obviously Andrew was getting at the value of note-taking. Practicing note-taking skills is critical to keep up with the pace of change.\n  “Multi-Version Syndrome” Sometimes you are writing features for things that will not be released in the next release. There is a risk of losing information across multiple releases (e.g. publishing the wrong thing too soon, or the right thing too late). Clarify the release schedule as you go. A good safeguard against losing information is to rigorously understand release cycle cadence and priority.\n If your product isn’t mature yet, anticipate change instead of avoiding it.\n  Access to technology is critical Technical writers are often User 0. To understand the technology, you need access. There are interactive and non-interactive ways of getting access. Interactive ways are preferred because they are always reproducible.\n   Interactive\n  Deploy your own\n  Get someone else to deploy it for you (but lose install context)\n     Non-interactive\n  Live demos\n  Demo videos\n  Asciicinema (CLI-oriented)\n         Other takeaways   Screenshots have high maintainability cost; avoid if possible\n  Sometimes good stop-gaps until something more maintainable\n     Where to begin? Make a table-of-contents for the Minimum Viable Product\n  Never underestimate outlines\n     Avoid documentation scramble near release day:\n  Make lists \/ check-lists\n  Take more notes\n  Pre-release checklist\n  Think now, and for the future\n     Audit your docs: On-boarding new people is a powerful opportunity to test out your docs\n   Thanks Andrew for a deep dive on this narrow but important topic.\n   </p>",

							value: "Issue templates",
							label: "<p>This guide is an introduction to issue templates in an Open Source project. While this guide is customized to GitHub, the advice provided here is general and can be applied to other collaboration platforms that offer templating. By the end of this guide, you will have a basic understanding of why issue templates are important and how to set up effective templates for your project. This guide is complementary to an agile or scrum workflow, if your team already uses one of these methods of project management.\n The following topics are covered:\n  About issue templates\n  Case study: TeleIRC\n  Additional resources\n   About issue templates Issue templates are a common feature of GitHub, GitLab, and other git forges. They allow you to pre-populate a new issue with template text. Issue templates can also automatically apply an assignee or label to a template, depending on the type of feedback it is. Some common issue templates in Open Source projects may look like the following:\n   Bug reports\n  New feature requests\n  Improvements to existing functionality\n   These are three common templates, but your project may use more or less depending on the unique context of your project. Issue templates are effective tools to structure new feedback and save time in the Open Source development life-cycle.\n See the official GitHub documentation for issue templates to learn more about using issue templates on GitHub.\n Why? Issue templates are helpful for both newcomers and core team members in your community. Project newcomers benefit from extra guidance and prompts on what to include in their reports. They might be asked to provide specific information, like what version of the application they use, what web browser or operating system they use, and so forth. It also saves core team members time in reviewing new feedback from the community. The necessary information is provided in the original comment; you do not have to follow-up and ask for more common information.\n Issue templates are not always useful in the earliest stages of an Open Source project. However, they are a strategic tool to scale participation in your project as you grow your community. Over time, you will invite more people to participate in your Open Source code, whether it is end-users, customers and clients, academic researchers, or grassroots activists. Issue templates help you engage a community in the earliest stages of growth in an Open Source project.\n    Case study: TeleIRC To demonstrate how issue templates work, we will look at the TeleIRC project. TeleIRC is an Open Source back-end application to connect Telegram groups and Internet Relay Chat channels together. TeleIRC uses issue templates to structure different types of feedback from developers and end-users. Take a look at the four templates available in the project:\n    The following screenshot shows an example of a reporter using the \u0026#34;bug report\u0026#34; template to report a bug:\n    These templates are used to quickly diagnose problems, discover interests in new features, and cut some of the chase out of troubleshooting. Find the exact templates used by the TeleIRC project in their .github\/ folder.\n   Additional resources   devspace\/awesome-github-templates: Curated list of GitHub Issues and Pull Requests templates\n  stevemao\/github-issue-templates: Wide range of issue templates you can customize for your own repositories.\n     </p>",

							label: "<p> This document is a maintainer’s guide for the UNICEF Open Source Inventory. Yes, this very site! This guide covers key information and helpful resources, as well as best practices when maintaining the O.S. Inventory.\n Contribution conventions This section explains contribution conventions for the Open Source Inventory. These are common conventions that all contributors are asked to make when contributing to this repository. Please make a best effort to follow these conventions at all times, unless there is a justified reason to break convention.\n Label conventions All issue and pull request labels belong to one of the meta-categories of labels below:\n  C omponent: Used for indicating what component, or part, of the applications is related. In a large project, there are different kinds of components that exist together in a repository. The UNICEF Open Source Inventory includes content management, front-end code, and back-end code. Usually indicates what kind of maintainer is needed to move forward.\n  I nclusion: Used for community inclusion topics. Issues or pull requests tagged with inclusion labels typically impact the contribution workflow and other people working on the project.\n  T ype: What types of issues and pull requests do we get? These labels indicate whether something new is added or if improvements are made to existing components.\n  X: Used for close statuses. These labels are only used on closed issues and pull requests.\n  ?: Used for labels that require more information. Usually indicates experienced maintainer action is required to move forward.\n    Commit message conventions  Prefix your commit message with the component you are changing, and optionally, an emoji. If you are editing a page in the Project Management category, start your commit message with Project Management:. If you are changing Hugo configurations, archetypes, or other tweaks, start your commit with message with hugo:. And so on. Optionally, you may add a GitHub emoji to your commit message summary line that best represents your change.\n  All commit messages on the main branch should be good commit messages.\n  Avoid merge commits. Preserve good commit messages by rebase merging, or if commit messages are not helpful in aggregate, use squash merging. Do not allow merge commits.\n    How to update git submodule as a maintainer There are two components to this Hugo website: content repository (unicef\/inventory) and theme repository (unicef\/inventory-hugo-theme).\n The content repository hosts all of the written information published in the O.S. Inventory. The theme repository hosts the front-end design and Hugo templates used in the O.S. Inventory. The content repository clones the theme repository as a git submodule to the themes\/inventory\/ path. Therefore, whenever changes are made to the upstream theme repository, the git submodule for the theme repository needs to be updated. The git submodule must be updated from the content repository.\n Example: git in command line The shell commands below were tested with the git command line client, version 2.31 or later:\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  git submodule update --remote --rebase cd themes\/inventory\/ git fetch git checkout \u0026lt;latest commit hash\u0026gt; cd ..\/..\/ git add themes\/inventory git commit --signoff      How development decisions are prioritized Development decisions are prioritized according to the needs of the following stakeholders:\n  UNICEF Office of Innovation staff and consultants\n  UNICEF Innovation Fund grantees and portfolio companies\n  UNICEF colleagues\n  UN colleagues\n  Open Source practitioners and subject-matter experts (e.g. associated to a private-sector Open Source Program Office)\n  General public\n   For as long as this list does not generate conflict, this is sufficient to guide development decisions by meeting the needs of key stakeholders. Over time, if this list creates friction, this part of the maintainer’s guide should be revisited.\n    Common resources and cheat sheets This section provides common resources, links, and references for different subject material covered in the project. See the sub-headings below for quick references on any aspect of the UNICEF Open Source Inventory.\n AsciiDoc syntax cheat sheet  AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text.\n  — asciidoctor.org    AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference  Handy cheat sheet of what the AsciiDoc markup looks like. Use this for quick references and checking up on how to formatting, lists, media content (images and video), table of contents, and more.\n AsciiDoc Recommended Practices  Best practices about writing in AsciiDoc. Most importantly, note that every sentence should be on its own line.\n    Hugo documentation  Hugo Documentation  Main landing page for upstream Hugo documentation. This is the first resource to check when exploring more advanced feature development and changes to the site theme.\n Hugo Community  Discussion and Q\u0026amp;A forum for upstream Hugo community. Good place to take questions, queries, and doubts about working with Hugo.\n GitHub  Upstream GitHub repository for Hugo. Issue tracker is usually responsive. If you hit a bug or something seems wrong, open an issue and seek help from a maintainer after you did your own homework.\n   Suggested reading Not sure where to start?

This page provides an overview of the different modules currently offered through the Open Source Mentorship programme.\n  Offered modules\n Legal \u0026amp; Licensing: Foundations of Open Source intellectual property\n  Launching your Open Source project\n  Open Source documentation\n  Continuous Integration for continuous contribution\n  Archetypes: Shape and size of Open Source over time\n     Module programming\n 12-month Innovation Fund contracts\n Q1\n  Q2\n  Q3\n  Q4\n         Offered modules The following modules are currently offered in UNICEF-facilitated mentorship:\n Legal \u0026amp; Licensing: Foundations of Open Source intellectual property  Building an Open Source community is like building a house. A good house must have a solid foundation, and Open Source projects are no different. The licenses surrounding Open Source, sometimes called Free Software, are part of the foundation of your Open Source project. This module introduces the Open Source Definition, the types of Open Source licenses, and how to be strategic and intentional in your choice of licenses.\n The Open Source licenses are the legal foundation of your project. By the end of this module, you should understand how the limits and bounds of your Open Source license impact the rules of your business model.\n   Topics included:\n   Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)\n  Licenses (MIT License, Apache License, GPL licenses, etc.)\n  Copyleft licenses\n  Permissive licenses\n     Open Source business models\n  Open Source Definition\n  Open Source Initiative\n    Launching your Open Source project  Lift-off! You know your licensing strategy and you are ready to go Open Source. Now what? This module introduces Open Source forges and collaboration platforms. You will learn how to use these tools effectively and efficiently, as well as ways to structure your project in order to scale with a community over time.\n This module is for early-stage Open Source projects that are still in active development. By the end of this module, you should understand common Open Source development workflows and how to enable collaboration with advanced features of your source code-hosting platform.\n   Topics included:\n   Brand and identity\n  Git platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Pagure, etc.\n  Pull Request workflow\n  READMEs\n  Using issues to manage product feedback\n    Open Source documentation  If everyone knew a programming language, source code alone might be enough. But most people do not know a programming language, and some people who use your project will not be engineers or developers with specialized knowledge. Planning, creating, and maintaining Open Source documentation fills an unavoidable gap to improve accessibility and understanding of your Open Source project. This module introduces the following:\n   Common tools and platforms used for Open Source documentation;\n  How to build an automated pipeline to deploy new documentation in real-time;\n  Building a documentation culture and community in your project;\n  Creating structure to enable external contributions to documentation.\n   By the end of this module, your project will have an Open Source documentation site and a plan on how to maintain the documentation over time. This module is for any Open Source project, at any stage, that wants to improve their documentation acumen and invite others to collaborate and contribute.\n   Topics included:\n   Automation tools (e.g. GitHub Actions, Circle CI, etc.)\n  Contribution guidelines\n  Documentation for developers\n  Documentation for users\n  Tool-chains\n  Python Sphinx\n  Hugo\n  Docusaurus (Facebook)\n       Continuous Integration for continuous contribution  As in life, Open Source projects will change over time. As you manage new changes to the source code of a project, how do you verify that new changes do not break existing code? You can spend time manually validating changes and testing them locally. But you can also automate it using workflow automation tools. This module introduces Continuous Integration (C.I.) and Continuous Deployment (C.D.) in an Open Source context.\n By the end of this module, your project will have a working CI\/CD pipeline for your Open Source repositories. New changes to the repositories will be validated against a basic set of tests, depending on what kind of software you are building. This module is for any Open Source project, at any stage, that wants to improve code quality, code health, and save time from manually testing and validating new code changes.\n   Topics included:\n   CI\/CD platforms (e.g. Circle CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)\n  Code test coverage and unit tests, if applicable\n  Deploy new changes to software or documentation to a testing or production environment\n  Pull Request Workflows with a CI pipeline\n  Code health tools to monitor and alert to best practices and warning signs\n    Archetypes: Shape and size of Open Source over time  Building an Open Source community is like building a house. Before you can invite people over, you need a solid foundation to build your community on. If you have completed the previous modules, your project is primed for working with new contributors. This reflective module introduces you to the Mozilla Open Source Archetypes report and understanding a theory of change for Open Source.\n By the end of this module, you will have an understanding of the different forms an Open Source project and community may take. You will also be able to identify where your project falls and make predictions on where it will go next. This module is for any Open Source project anticipating growth, change, or evolution to its code or the community.\n   Topics included:\n   Project archetypes:\n  Business-to-Business (B2B) Open Source\n  Multi-Vendor Infrastructure\n  Rocket Ship to Mars\n  Controlled Ecosystem\n  Wide Open\n  Mass Market\n  Speciality Library\n  Trusted Vendor\n  Upstream Dependency\n     Business models:\n  Professional\/enterprise versions\n  Services around your product\n  Services *are* your product\n  Content\n  Packaging\n  Franchising\n  Training\n         Module programming The above modules are typically offered in groups with other modules. The programmes and most common combination of modules are described below:\n 12-month Innovation Fund contracts 12 months is the standard length of the Open Source Mentorship programme. 12-month contracts are typically offered through the procurement process through the UNICEF Innovation Fund. The breakdown below orders the modules and adds context to what content is covered.\n Q1: Foundations This quarter focuses on establishing an Open Source project and laying the groundwork for future work.\n Milestones:\n   Determine licensing strategy for Open Source intellectual property (i.e. permissive or copyleft). Apply an Open Source Initiative-approved license to a public source code repository.\n  Create READMEs (in English) for all public repositories. READMEs should include:\n  Overview of specific repo\n  Developer environment instructions (i.e. how to set software up)\n  Note how repo connects into overall product\n  List of any Open Source software used to create product (including tools and frameworks).\n     Create a public Open Source documentation with a corresponding public source code repository.

							value: "Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)",
							label: "<p> Originally authored by Mike Nolan, edited and maintained by Justin W. Flory.\n This page introduces Contributor License Agreements (shortened C.L.As) in Open Source projects.\n What are they for? Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) are often used in Open Source projects to form a legal agreement between an individual or company and a project maintainer. This agreement usually includes a waiver of copyright (although not always) as well as the right to patent their contribution.\n CLAs became popular during the early 2000s in open source. Prior to platforms like GitHub and GitLab, patches were often emailed to mailing lists and manually accepted by maintainers. Unfortunately, email patches did not always make clear the waiver of rights to whichever license the codebase was licensed under. To minimize the maintainer’s risk, CLAs made that waiver of rights explicit.\n Criticism of CLAs CLAs are less popular, even on large projects, due to the popularity and use of platforms such as GitHub. GitHub Terms of Service explicitly state a user waives their copyright to whichever license is included in the repository at that time of the contribution. This is considered by most to fulfill the need of a CLA.\n    What alternatives exist? Other than the GitHub Terms of Service, the Linux Foundation introduced a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a more lightweight method to have developers waive their rights. Instead of maintaining a database of signed contracts, users can simply sign using specific formatting of commit messages provided a project publishes a CLA\/DCO in its repository.\n Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA) The Fedora Project, an open source Linux distribution, has its Fedora Project Contributor Agreement, or FPCA. Agreeing to the FPCA is required to contribute in the Fedora Project. However, it does not take away legal ownership of contributions. It only asserts that Fedora has default permission to use contributions under a permissive free license.\n This is an innovative legal strategy to encourage open source collaboration without:\n  Anyone waiving their copyright\n  Adding risk for project maintainers\n      What do I need for my own CLA? Unlike licenses, CLAs are not standardized due to lack of widespread adoption. Apache has an individual CLA which can be used as base. It is highly recommended to work with a lawyer or legal professional to draft or modify a CLA to ensure there is clarity on which rights you expect contributors to waive.\n Alternatively, the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (above) presents an interesting alternative model to reduce friction in certain scenarios.\n   </p>",

							value: "Good first issues",
							label: "<p>Flory, Justin W.\n    This Mission is a guide to making \u0026#34;good first issues\u0026#34; (shortened to G.F.I.\u0026#39;s) for your Open Source community. To create good GFIs, we will explore these Objectives for this Mission:\n  GFIs exist\n  Assignee ratio\n  Simple language\n  Actionable\n  Purpose\n  Deadlines\n  Low committment\n  References\n   GFIs exist The first requirement to having good GFIs is to… create GFIs!\n In the case of writing new GFIs, it is usually better to publish something sooner than later, and not overthink it. For an individual \u0026#34;core\u0026#34; repository (however you measure that), you should have 3-5 unassigned GFIs for new contributors. Having a few different GFIs gives people options to try different things based on their comfort and experience. What is easy to one person may not be easy to another.\n Unless your project is already large and has a big community, limit no more than five GFIs per core repository. It is good to have opportunity, but you also do not want to overwhelm a new contributor with so many choices. They are still learning about your project, so it is better to be simple.\n   Assignee ratio Having GFIs is helpful, but making sure people can actually volunteer for them is important too. Make sure more of your GFIs (\u0026gt;60%) are unassigned.\n If you have GFIs on your project, you want to make sure people are invited to work on them. If someone is working on a GFI, they should be added as the assignee. If you have more assigned issues than unassigned issues, that is a sign to make more GFIs.\n   Simple language Open source is international. Whatever language you use, keep it simple and avoid complicated words.\n Sometimes it is hard to use simple language for a project. Do your best attempt. A good way to double-check is to ask someone else to read for comprehension and get their feedback. Since GFIs are for new contributors, it is important to keep the language beginner-friendly.\n (Si tu proyecto fuera en español, yo necesitaría tu ayuda para usar palabras sencillas para entender lo que quieres. ¡Ya que no soy un hispanohablante nativo!)\n   Actionable GFIs should be easy to tell if they are \u0026#34;done\u0026#34; or not. Define closing \/ success criteria up front in GFI descriptions.\n A new contributor will not understand your project the same way as a lead developer. What is obvious to an experienced team member is not always obvious to a newcomer. So, make it easy for a newcomer to understand what success looks like. Is it a different look in the front-end? Is it a specific output in the terminal? Be clear in what you are looking for in a contribution to avoid wasted time.\n   Purpose Anyone who contributes to a project wants their contribution to count. Make sure GFIs add real benefits or improvements to your project.\n There are many things that motivate Open Source contributors. One motivation is knowing that an improvement or change is useful or helpful to a project. Few people will want to work on something that does not have real, added value to your project. So, do your best to make sure GFIs have some real purpose in the project, even if it is small.\n This can also help to \u0026#34;level up\u0026#34; a new contributor to bigger and larger tasks. Adding an improvement and seeing its impact in the project is a great feeling! They may have increased confidence to work up to bigger things in your project.\n   Deadlines GFIs do not need absolute, hard deadlines. But make sure GFIs have a rough estimate or timeline for completion.\n Deadlines are helpful for a few reasons:\n  Keeps a contributor accountable to completing work\n  Easier for maintainers to follow up and open a task back up to the community, if needed\n  Outside contributors can find more useful work to contribute to\n   The purpose of deadlines is not to give someone a hard requirement they must meet. Be flexible and be kind, especially if they are a volunteer or unpaid to work on your project. Loose deadlines can be an effective tool for a contributor to pace themselves on new work. They also make sure new contributors get to work on something that is more immediately useful to the project, instead of something that is a more distant or future goal.\n   Low committment Finally, keep the bar low for commitment. Encourage new contributors to take on new work, but avoid adding serious pressure on them for completing a GFI.\n If someone volunteers to work on a GFI and does not complete it, this should not be a problem. GFIs are usually \u0026#34;nice to have\u0026#34; tasks. They should not have impacts to product delivery time or important milestones. (They can be related to important milestones, so long as they are not major work commitments.)\n Be kind if someone does need to drop a GFI. There are any number of reasons they might not complete the work. It is okay to ask someone if they need help, or why they did not complete the work. But do not pressure them to finish the work or complete it if they are unsure.\n   References Find more practical examples of GFIs and other useful resources below:\n Resources \u0026amp; tools   First Timers Only: Combined resource featuring several different sites, resources, and other links.\n  Fedora Project easyfix: List of tasks in the Fedora Project that were evaluated to have easy entrance points for new contributors.\n  Up For Grabs: List of projects with curated tasks specifically for new contributors.

							value: "Project boards",
							label: "<p>This guide is an introduction to project boards for your open source project. By the end of this guide, you will have a basic understanding of how to run project planning in an open, transparent way to your community. What this guide is NOT is a guide to agile\/scrum development. You should have a basic understanding of agile, scrum, and\/or kanban before reading this article.\n The following topics are covered:\n  About project boards\n  Case study: TeleIRC\n  Examples\n  Additional resources\n   About project boards Project boards are planning tools to help you track, monitor, and map software development. Project boards are compatible with several different development methodologies and processes, such as scrum, agile, waterfall, kanban, and more. In open source, project boards are one way to practice transparency in software development. It also provides easier on-ramps for new contributors to your software project(s).\n GitHub, GitLab, and several other code hosting platforms offer project boards as a feature. The project boards integrate closely with software development and issue tracking, to make them accessible and available to developers and project managers. For an agile-like approach, a basic kanban board is the recommended \u0026#34;entry-level\u0026#34; approach to launching your first public project board. A project board for a new open source project might use the following columns:\n   Backlog\n  Blocked \/ waiting on external\n  To do\n  In progress\n  Done\n   For new projects, a good initial goal is to surface approximately two weeks of development priorities in your project board(s).\n Why? Why do project boards matter for your open source community? Some of the key reasons are highlighted below:\n  Avoid duplication of work: New contributors can see what tasks are in progress by core team members. They can choose to work on other tasks that are not yet taken up.\n  Emphasize development priorities to community: Project boards help you communicate what work is most valuable to your project. A potential contributor can see the tasks that are important to the team, and they may choose to work on this task instead of working on a smaller, less helpful change.\n  Keep development on track: Project boards are generally a useful tool for understanding how developers are spending their time on the project. It also makes it easier to visualize overall team bandwidth (e.g. if someone is overloaded or if someone could take on a stretch goal in a sprint).\n      Case study: TeleIRC The TeleIRC project is a small open source community that uses project boards to guide development. See the below board as an example:\n   Figure 1. July 2020 screenshot of TeleIRC GitHub developer project board (click to open)  This is an advanced example. Guidelines that project managers use for this board are explained below:\n   Columns:\n  Done: Work done in the current sprint. Each new sprint, this column is reset.\n  Current sprint: All work to be completed in the current sprint. All tasks must have an explicit assignee or lead.\n  Next sprint: Work that will be started in the next sprint. This list helps prioritize what is coming up next from the backlog. Might also be titled Ready.\n     Use of milestones: Issues are tagged in relation to planned releases. In the above example, there are bugfix releases (v2.0.1), feature releases (v2.1.0), and undetermined releases (v2.x.x).\n  Clear issue labels: All issues are labeled in helpful ways. For example, every issue must be labeled either as \u0026#34;new change\u0026#34; or an \u0026#34;improvement\u0026#34; (to something that is already implemented).\n   Questions?

							label: "<p>This page defines and provides examples of Open Source governance. This includes Open Source project governance models, examples of other projects, frameworks for decision-making, and more.\n This page is a work-in-progress. Check back later for future additions.\n What is Open Source governance? The phrase \u0026#34;Open Source governance\u0026#34; generally refers to the decision-making model or documented process for how an Open Source project makes decisions. Sustainable governance is essential if an Open Source project will last, especially if it involves multiple stakeholders and collaborators. But what governance models or frameworks are sustainable? What makes sense for your Open Source project? The answer is, it depends.\n Documenting and defining a governance model for a project is a radical act of transparency. It is an advance commitment to deciding how decisions are made, who gets to have a say, and how community feedback is factored into the process. Sometimes governance models need to be changed in the future; this is normal. A good governance model captures the core values and beliefs of the project, and gives key stakeholders a voice in the future of the project. It also includes a process to adapt or change, to accommodate unexpected changes in society and norms over time.\n This page serves as a reference point for you to determine a governance model for your Open Source project. Although models and examples are included below, do not take them as an absolute truth. There is room for creativity and adaption; the right governance model for your project might be a combination of the models explained here.\n   Models This section is deferred. A list of examples or generic examples will be added later.

							value: "GPLv2 vs. GPLv3",
							label: "<p>The information shared on this page does not constitute legal or financial advice.\n This page provides an interpretation of the key differences between v2 and v3 of the GNU Public License, or G.P.L. The key differences are summarized in each section below.\n Why update? Stallman’s objection to Tivoization In the early 2000s, American corporation TiVo Inc. was criticized by the Free Software community for their popular digital video recorder (DVR) product. Free Software activist Richard M. Stallman criticized how TiVo violated the spirit of Free Software by placing software restrictions on their hardware products.\n The TiVo projects relied on the popular Open Source Linux platform. Because Linux used the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2), TiVo was required to distribute source code for anyone who receives the software. Stallman asserted TiVo circumventing this goal by blocking users from running modified software on its hardware by design. TiVo products would only run programs whose digital signature matched those authorized by TiVo.\n This loophole was controversial. In 2006, the Free Software Foundation would respond with a new version of the GNU Public License, version 3. It included language to avoid this loophole, which commonly became known as Tivoization.\n Other opinions The GPLv3 was generally well-received. However, there are criticisms over the GPLv3 and its restrictions.\n Linus Torvalds and Linux Not everyone agreed to the added language to the GPLv3. One of the largest projects to adopt the GPLv2, Linux, chose not to upgrade the license. Linus Torvalds, the lead developer of Linux, asserts that the GPLv3 goes against what the GPLv2 means for him as a software developer:\n     Bradley Kuhn on implementation Some Software Freedom activists believe the GPLv3 did not actually close the \u0026#34;Tivoization\u0026#34; loophole. Bradley M. Kuhn, Policy Fellow and Hacker-in-Residence of the Software Freedom Conservancy, notes challenges on this issue in spite of the GPLv3.\n  The narrative about addressing [Tivoization] in GPLv3 was centered around the first discussion draft, but no one ever made the case (rather they made the assumption) that \u0026#34;scripts used to install\u0026#34; wouldn’t include everything that GPLv3 Installation Information requires. If you look at Draft 1 of GPLv3, you see the Installation Information definition is substantially broader. So, a question to ask at the end of the GPLv3 process, when looking at the final draft, is \u0026#34;Is there anything in GPLv3’s definition of Installation Information that would not be required to produce as a \u0026#39;script used to control installation\u0026#39;\u0026#34;? That’s an open question [and] people disagree.\n    — Bradley M. Kuhn       Legal overview The rest of this document takes a focused look at precise differences between the two licenses. These came from a direct comparison between the two texts.\n Anti-Circumvention Law In section 3, the GPL offers protections for user rights from anti-circumvention law. This makes an interesting external reference to article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty signed on 20 December 1996. It appears to make clear provisions that waive legal power to forbid circumvention of the GPLv3-covered work. It makes this requirement in the context of the WIPO Copyright Treaty to strengthen its appeal.\n  User Product rules The GPL Frequently Asked Questions page explains this well:\n  Some devices utilize free software that can be upgraded, but are designed so that users are not allowed to modify that software. There are lots of different ways to do this; for example, sometimes the hardware checksums the software that is installed, and shuts down if it doesn’t match an expected signature. The manufacturers comply with GPLv2 by giving you the source code, but you still don’t have the freedom to modify the software you’re using. We call this practice tivoization.\n When people distribute User Products that include software under GPLv3, section 6 requires that they provide you with information necessary to modify that software. User Products is a term specially defined in the license; examples of User Products include portable music players, digital video recorders, and home security systems.\n  — GPL Frequently Asked Questions    Cure period and the GPL Cooperation Commitment The GPLv3 includes an explicit cure period. A cure period is like a grace period to fix a violation of the License. Violators have 30 days after notification of noncompliance to \u0026#34;reinstate\u0026#34; their License by fixing the violation. If the violation is cured in the cure period, there is no harm, no foul.\n Technically, with the GPLv2, an actor may choose to immediately pursue legal action for noncompliance with the terms of the GPLv2. In September 2015, the Free Software Foundation and Software Freedom Conservancy jointly published the Principles of Community-Oriented Enforcement. This was the first call-to-action to propose the backport of the GPLv3 termination clause to GPLv2. These guidelines inspired the creation of the GPL Cooperation Commitment in 2017, driven by Red Hat. In order to address this imbalance in GPLv2 license enforcement, Red Hat, IBM, Google, and Facebook announced the GPL Cooperation Commitment in November 2017 to apply the GPLv3 cure provisions for their GPLv2 and LGPLv2.x licensed software.\n  \u0026#34;Legalese\u0026#34; The GPLv3 is nearly double the length of the GPLv2 (5,644 words vs. 2,971 words). The GPLv3 reads more like a legal document than the GPLv2. That said, there is a lot more \u0026#34;legal speak\u0026#34; in version 3 than its predecessor. This works to the advantage of Software Freedom by using more concrete and defined language to spell out how the GPL was commonly applied and understood before 2007.\n Most of these changes are minor or trivial, and so are not explained here. One example of this is in section 9, \u0026#34;Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\u0026#34; Unlike the GPLv2, version 3 better defines that you indicate acceptance of the License by modifying or propagating a GPLv3-covered work.\n    </p>",

Goal of material is to acquire best practices for hardware documentation and understand the different open licensing options available. Includes an explanation video and other helpful links.\n     Licenses There are two generally accepted Open Hardware licenses:\n   CERN Open Hardware Licence\n  TAPR Open Hardware License\n   Each can come with its own strategy. For example, the 2.0 version of the CERN open hardware license includes three versions:\n   \u0026#34;Weakly\u0026#34; reciprocal\n  \u0026#34;Strongly\u0026#34; reciprocal\n  Non-reciprocal\n   A reciprocal license is similar to copyleft for software licenses, meaning others who make use of your work must share their derivatives under the same license. This way, no one can take what you made, make changes, and turn it into a closed-source product. You will benefit from others’ contributions, especially if you build a community around your product.\n Don’t Fear the Patent Clause! A talk from Deb Nicholson at LinuxFest Northwest 2018:\n  Several different patent clauses are embedded in modern open source licenses and there’s some confusion about exactly what they each mean. Most developers would prefer to have nothing to do with patents or patent clauses, but avoiding the topic isn’t a smart strategy. None of the popular clauses have been tested in court, so no one can predict exactly how the courts might deal with hybrid copyright and patent licenses.\n That said, savvy open source participants can still make some reasonable assumptions based on the license author’s intentions, trends in patent law and the way other common open source licenses have functioned. Understanding the players and the history that lead to patent clauses in open source licenses will help practitioners make informed choices about what licenses to apply to their own work and how these various licenses can help large multi-stakeholder projects.\n  — Deb Nicholson         </p>",

As the international community now faces the historic challenge of vaccinating the world, more attention and resources must be directed to the innovators who are developing technically novel, contextually relevant, and socially inclusive alternatives to mainstream innovation management practices.\u0026#34;\n    For example, innovators in low- and middle-income countries have developed numerous solutions that rely almost entirely on off-the-shelf parts that can be found in hardware stores. One example that quickly reached the Indian market is the AgVa portable ventilator, which:\n   Doesn’t need an oxygen supply (it oxygenates room air)\n  Builds on the computational power of mobile phones and a dedicated app\n  Weighs a fraction of typical commercial ventilators, making it easily portable\n  Has open-source specifications, making it adaptable for use in other countries and contexts\n  Costs less than a tenth of conventional ventilators and can be produced much more quickly.\n    — hbr.org Published 9 June 2021 - copyright Harvard Business Review and shared under Fair Use or §107 Copyright Law of the United States (Title 17)     Legal and Business Aspects   Emerging Business Models for Open Source Hardware: Many ideas on open hardware business models.

This page provides an overview of the Fedora Linux distribution, project, and community.\n What is Fedora? Fedora is three different things, rolled into one.\n Linux kernel distribution Fedora is a Linux kernel distribution. The Linux kernel is just one part of a computer system. To make Linux useful, you need to combine it with other software and an interface that someone can use for a purpose. Fedora is a Linux distribution, just like many others (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, CentOS\/RHEL, etc.).\n  Project Fedora is a project. Fedora provides a Free and Open Source software platform for innovative technology. New technologies can be explored and tested in ways that few other projects can offer. This way, Fedora becomes a platform for collaboration on user-focused solutions built on that platform. Successful implementations of technology in Fedora often result in wide-spread adoption through downstream projects, like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and many other Linux distributions.\n The one-liner often used to describe Fedora is below:\n  In plain English, we make an operating system and we make it easy for you do useful stuff with it.\n  — Fedora\u0026#39;s Mission and Foundations    Community Fedora is a community. Not just any community, but a global community spanning multiple continents. Fedora places strong value in its community. Fedora contributors are not just contributors, but people with their own lives and stories. People involved with Fedora tend to be passionate about what they do and the people they collaborate with.\n    Background For additional background about the Fedora Project, see its Wikipedia page.\n  The Fedora Project is an independent project to co-ordinate the development of Fedora Linux, a Linux kernel-based operating system, operating with the vision of \u0026#34;a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and open-minded communities.\u0026#34; The project’s mission statement is to create \u0026#34;an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and containers that enables software developers and community members to build tailored solutions for their users\u0026#34;. The project also oversees Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux, a special interest group which maintains the eponymous packages. The project was founded in 2003 as a result of a merger between the Red Hat Linux (RHL) and Fedora Linux projects. It is sponsored by Red Hat primarily, but its employees make up only 35% of project contributors, and most of the over 2,000 contributors are unaffiliated members of the community.\n  — Wikipedia contributors CC BY-SA 3.0     Get involved with Fedora Fedora has a team of people to help newcomers get involved with Fedora, known as the Fedora Join Special Interest Group. This is the best way to explore participation in Fedora and see what options there are out there.\n If you are a UNICEF Innovation Fund company, reach out to your Open Source Mentor for extra guidance in an Open Source check-in call.\n   </p>",

The needs assessment is a tool to collect background and context for each team’s experience and familiarity with open source. It also builds understanding for participation in existing open source communities. This template provides structure and guidance on what to ask to any team at the beginning of an Open Source Mentorship program.\n Your current situation This section helps us understand where each team is at the moment.\n  What current milestones is the team working towards? Can be development and\/or business.\n  How much of your project source code is already on a git hosting platform, e.g. GitHub \/ GitLab? Either public or private is okay.\n  Based on what you know about Open Source today, what challenges or concerns do you have about Open Source specifically?\n  Is there any prior Open Source development experience on your team?\n  Do you have an existing user community?\n  Does your project source code extend or make improvements to an already-existing Open Source project? (a.k.a. upstream)\n     Project management These questions explore project management and any tools or processes that are already in place.\n  Is your team fully remote, partially remote, or all in-person?\n  Does your team use a project management methodology? (e.g. agile, scrum, waterfall)\n  How often does your development team meet?\n  What project management tools are you already using? (e.g. Trello, Asana, GitHub Projects, JIRA, etc.)\n     Development best practices These questions explore development best practices and how the team produces source code. It covers a range of periphery activities around development, such as unit testing, static analysis, automation, and more. The goal is to understand where the team is currently, and where Open Source Mentorship will focus initially. This intersects with other topics like Continuous Integration.\n Testing  Does the current project source code have ANY unit, functional, and\/or integration tests?\n If yes: Estimate a percentage of how much code is currently tested.\n  If yes: What testing frameworks are used?\n       Tooling  Do you already use any static analysis or code health-checking tools?\n  Are any automation tools already in use? (e.g. Ansible, Chef, Docker containers, GitHub Actions, etc.)\n    Workflow  Is any developer on the team able to add code directly to the product, or are contributions peer-reviewed before merging?\n      Documentation These questions explore documentation culture. Some teams may do this better than others at the start, but the goal is to establish a baseline.\n  READMEs: Do core repositories have a README file that explains what the repo is, how it works at a high-level, and how that single repo integrates into your overall product?\n  Developer documentation: Is any documentation already written about how to set up a local development environment for any of your projects? Does not have to be stored in git.\n     Vision These questions explore Open Source vision. It gets the team thinking about where we are going and what the next steps might be in reaching that vision.\n  What does success look like in a world in 12 months when you have launched your Open Source projects?\n  Name one thing that needs to change today on your team in order to accomplish this vision. (suggestion: everyone on the call should answer this one!)\n     Archived questions These questions were once included in the needs assessment, but are no longer asked. This is because the answers to these questions are either documented elsewhere, or they are better answered asynchronously.\n See archived questions     What is your product elevator pitch? (i.e. describe project in 2-3 sentences) If you could grade how well your team does open source, what grade would you give yourself and why? Do you hold daily or weekly meetings to track progress with the core development team? Did you receive peer reviews on your code base in the last three months by someone outside of your organization?        </p>",

These resources will help you figure out the differences between the most common copyleft licenses.\n   What is the difference between GPL, AGPL and LGPL licenses? - Quora\n  Why the Affero GPL - Free Software Foundation (FSF)\n      Examples These are a collection of specific examples or scenarios with Open Source licenses. They may cover specific projects using a specific license, or may be more general-purpose considerations for any license.\n Software licenses   I enforced the AGPL on my code, here’s how it went: When enforcing a copyleft license resulted in non-cooperation instead of collaboration. While effective at protecting your work, copyleft licenses can be overwhelming to others who do not understand Open Source. The practical example in this article is a good reminder of possible outcomes when it comes to enforcing copyleft licenses.\n    Content licenses   Creative Commons NonCommercial clause:\n  Does my use violate the Creative Commons NonCommercial clause of the licenses?: Commonly misunderstood, the NonCommercial clause of the Creative Commons licenses are clear in prohibiting uses that are “primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.” This F.A.Q. by the Creative Commons offers more details on what NonCommercial implies.\n  NonCommercial interpretation: The NonCommercial license element, explained.
