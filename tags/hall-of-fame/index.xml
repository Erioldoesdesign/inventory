 Opentrons Scientific-focused hardware.
  Several highly successful and well-regarded biology/chemistry lab automation robots. By going 100% open source, they substantially reduced costs. Their productsâ€™ prices sometimes undercuts competition by 10x. They also acquired venture capital (V.C.) funding.
 Having worked in biology labs myself, I can attest to how revolutionary their open source business model is.</description>
