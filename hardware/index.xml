      <description>Below are more detailed case studios of different Open Hardware organizations, projects, and products. Unlike the Projects page, these examples are more detailed and provide more context.
Opentrons Scientific-focused hardware.
 Several highly successful and well-regarded biology/chemistry lab automation robots. By going 100% open source, they substantially reduced costs. Their products&#39; prices sometimes undercuts competition by 10x. They also acquired venture capital (V.C.) funding.
Having worked in biology labs myself, I can attest to how revolutionary their open source business model is.</description>

      <description>This page collects information, resources, and other details about Open Hardware licensing.
Documentation  Licensing and documentation: Learning material provided by Open Hardware Leaders program. Goal of material is to acquire best practices for hardware documentation and understand the different open licensing options available. Includes an explanation video and other helpful links.  Licenses There are two generally accepted Open Hardware licenses:
 CERN Open Hardware Licence TAPR Open Hardware License  Each can come with its own strategy.</description>
