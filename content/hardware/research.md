This is a draft page.
While it can exist in the source repo, it will not be visible on the main site until `draft: true` is removed.

## Crowd Supply

> BTW, for open source hardware crowdfunding, [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/) is a popular platform.
> Not all project on it are open source, but many are.

## Licensing

Also provided by Pen:

> I also note that there are different licensing strategies for open source hardware.
> For example, the [newly released 2.0 version of the CERN open hardware license](https://home.cern/news/news/knowledge-sharing/cern-updates-its-open-hardware-licence) has "weak" and "strongly" reciprocal, and non-reciprocal versions.
> A reciprocal license is similar to copyleft for software licenses, meaning others who make use of your work must share their results under the same license.
> The huge benefit is that no one can take what you made, add some changes, and turn it into a closed source product.
> This means that you will benefit from others' contributions, especially if you managed to build a community around your product.

### [Don't Fear the Patent Clause!](https://linuxfestnorthwest.org/conferences/lfnw18/program/proposals/72)

Provided by Deb Nicholson, probably worth reading/watching over this:

> Several different patent clauses are embedded in modern open source licenses and there's some confusion about exactly what they each mean.
> Most developers would prefer to have nothing to do with patents or patent clauses, but avoiding the topic isn't a smart strategy.
> None of the popular clauses have been tested in court, so no one can predict exactly how the courts might deal with hybrid copyright and patent licenses.
>
> That said, savvy open source participants can still make some reasonable assumptions based on the license author's intentions, trends in patent law and the way other common open source licenses have functioned.
> Understanding the players and the history that lead to patent clauses in open source licenses will help practitioners make informed choices about what licenses to apply to their own work and how these various licenses can help large multi-stakeholder projects.
